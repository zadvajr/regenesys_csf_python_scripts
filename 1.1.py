# Python Program for Arithmetic Operations:

# Store input numbers:
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')
num2 = input('Enter second number: ')

# Add two numbers
sum = float(num1) + float(num2)

# Subtract two numbers
min = float(num1) - float(num2)

# Multiply two numbers
mul = float(num1) * float(num2)

# Divide two numbers
div = float(num1) / float(num2)

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))

# Display the subtraction
print('The subtraction of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, min))

# Display the multiplication
print('The multiplication of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, mul))

# Display the division
print('The division of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))

# Output:
# Enter first number: 20
# Enter second number: 10
# The sum of 20 and 10 is 30.0
# The subtraction of 20 and 10 is 10.0
# The multiplication of 20 and 10 is 200.0
# The division of 20 and 10 is 30.0
